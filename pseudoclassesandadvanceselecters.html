<p>Space" refers to the three-dimensional expanse beyond Earth's atmosphere, an almost perfect vacuum that is nearly devoid of matter, and the continuum of time and space that makes up the universe. In the context of space exploration, it refers to the realm of celestial bodies and the ongoing human efforts to travel within and study this vast expanse. </p> 
<p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. This is enabled by Earth being an ocean world, the only one in the Solar System sustaining liquid surface water. Almost all of Earth's water is contained in its global ocean, covering 70.8% of Earth's crust.</p>
